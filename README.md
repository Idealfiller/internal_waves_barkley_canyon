Ocean Physics MSc thesis at the University of Victoria, under the supervision of Dr. Jody Klymak. This research seeks to characterise the internal wave field at Barkley Canyon, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. 

analysis.ipynb hosts primary code used for analysis of velocity data obtained from Ocean Networks Canada; contains processes for velocity, PSD, rotary spectra, and spectrogram plotting. Also allows for a selection of specific data ranges for depth and time, and rotates and cleans data.

'Documents' folder hosts working drafts of the Schedule, Analysis, and Proposal documents, and other useful information.

'plots' folder hosts plotting output from the analysis notebooks, for their respective analysis type (spectro_plots for spectrograms, etc.).

'Archive' folder contains outdated or no longer in use test-case notebooks, plots, and documents that are useful as a record, but are not currently used for analysis.
