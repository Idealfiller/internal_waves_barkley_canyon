# Internal waves in Barkley Canyon

Ocean Physics Master's thesis at the University of Victoria, under the supervision of Dr. Jody Klymak.

This research seeks to characterise the internal wave field at Barkley Canyon, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. 

analysis.ipynb hosts primary code used for analysis of velocity data obtained from Ocean Networks Canada; velocity, PSD, rotary spectra, and spectrograms. Also allows for a selection of specific data ranges for depth and time, and rotates and cleans data.

density_N2.ipynb takes formatted CTD data (from DFO, Line P cruises) and uses the Seawater analysis package to generate temperature, salinity, density, and buoyancy (N^2) plots.

X_plots folders are for plotting output from the analysis notebooks, for their respective analysis type (spectro_plots for spectrograms, etc.).

Archive folder contains outdated or no longer in use test-case notebooks, plots, and documents that are useful as a record, but do not contribute directly to the final thesis product.
